This is my coursework for the COMP2042 Software Maintenance module (2021).

# Brick_Destroy
This is a simple arcade video game.
The player's goal is to destroy a wall with a small ball.
The game has very simple commands:
SPACE to start/pause the game
A to move the player to the left
D to move the player to the right 
ESC to enter/exit pause menu 
ALT+SHIFT+F1 to open the console
The game automatically pauses if the frame loses focus.
